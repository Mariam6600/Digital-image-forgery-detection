Digital Image Forgery Detection: Methodology 2 **(Single-Input ResNet101V2)**
This project is part of a research thesis that explores the use of deep learning for detecting digital image forgery. This methodology investigates the potential of achieving high performance with only a single input type: Error Level Analysis (ELA).

# Methodology Summary
This approach relies on a ResNet101V2 neural network model that takes ELA images as a single input. The experiment focuses on leveraging the ELA technique's ability to highlight subtle changes in compression quality, which are often invisible to the human eye.

# Key Results
The model was trained on the **CASIA 2.0** dataset. It demonstrated strong performance, achieving:

Overall Accuracy: **87.00%**.

Best AUC Value: **0.88**.

Recall for Forged Class: **0.85**.

Although its performance was slightly lower than the dual-input model, it proved highly effective using only one type of input.
